# LLVM Demystified

### Getting started

We provide a docker image with an LLVM installation.
Make sure docker is installed and running on your system, then run `run_docker.sh` to fetch & enter the image.
While you can instead build and run your own LLVM stack locally, your mileage may vary.
The docker image is a stable environment to experiment with the examples in this repository.
